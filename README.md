# Larchier
A tiny hobby project (doesn't support Windows, *for now*), created by none other than the GOAT, the BOAT, the LOAT, **architelos**!!

Not the cleanest code, nor the least complex, but I'm happy :)

Fabric/Forge support coming *soon(TM)*!

## To run MC:
##### Fetch the repository, and then:
```bash
$ src/bin.js help
$ src/bin.js profile -a
$ src/bin.js profile -u
$ src/bin.js instance -a
$ src/bin.js launch
```
(standalone .exe also coming *soon(TM)*!!)
